		It takes millions of small steps to build capacities for our trainees. We start with training and the ultimate goal is to join the workforce – literally and figuratively. For those who need supervision and support this step is taken at our “Supported Work Centre”, others proudly step out, armed with their skills and our support. We stand aside with bated breath, our hearts in our hands like a mother who sends her toddler to play school for the first time.

Through this we smilingly encourage them because we strongly believe that gainful employment transforms lives. When people see the products created by out work associates, they recognise the capacities of our people. Young men and women work hard every day, to make an impressive range of products of the highest quality, at our employment centre. The products are marketed to retail clients and bulk orders are taken from various organisations.
