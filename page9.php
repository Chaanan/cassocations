		Very early into our existence, we realised that educating the family members is not only our biggest hurdle but also the biggest step in integrating our associates with the mainstream. Very often a parent burdened with grief, sadness and guilt, cannot fulfil the need of an intellectually disabled child. The needs can range from physical assistance to emotional nurturing.
To begin with, we help the family accept and understand the nature of the disability, its impact on the person as well on the other family members. Our counsellors are available every Thursday, with prior appointment, to sit with families and address their concerns and queries. We facilitate the process of obtaining disability certificate, legal guardianship and other benefits of the government schemes. Our counsellors also join the medical staff at AIIMS to help parents avail disability certificates and provide guidance and counselling.
