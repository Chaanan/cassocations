		Due to the marginalisation of adults with intellectual disability, very little effort is made to equip them with productive skills. Three decades ago we took it upon ourselves to discover their strengths and make them a part of the productive work force.
The outcome is our adult training centre, addressing the life cycle needs of individuals with intellectual disability. Here we help build life skills as well as vocational skills, instilling in them a sense of self-worth and dignity.

While vocational skills focus on training for employment, life skills include knowledge of a wide range of concepts and skills which are essential for adult living. Our work associates are at the core of what we do. All our programmes fulfil their needs and aspirations, helping them lead a productive and dignified life. It is amazing to see our students clearly express their feelings through various activities, once they have spent time at the training centre.

		1. Vocational Training
It is gratifying to see vocations perfected by Muskaan, over 26 years, adopted by other institutions. 
These vocations are easy to replicate because they are based on concrete mental operations with minimal
 abstraction and judgement capacity. Once the whole task is divided in sub units and put in an order 
 – simple to complex – our students learn better. When the entire series of operations are defined 
 and put in a predictable order, teaching and learning skills becomes easy. Major vocational activities 
 at Chaanan include:<br>

Block printing.<br>
Gift stationery items./ Paper Bag making<br>
Decorated candles and diyas.<br>
Papier-mâché, painting, pottery/ Art & craft products,<br>
Jewellery making<br>
Weaving.<br>
Snacks like delicious mathis & namkparas.<br>
Baking cakes and cookies.<br>
Pickles and squashes.<br>
Spices preparation & packing<br>
Solar drying of herbs and vegetables<br>
Processing Flowers<br>
Training is for Hospitality sector, Retail selling and Data Entry<br>
After familiarizing our trainees with various units, we focus on developing prevocational skills, which facilitates vocational learning by enabling them to follow discipline and group norms. The advantage of exposing them to all vocational activities is that they understand their interests and aptitudes, providing a sense of self identity and self-direction. Ultimately it helps them understand the demands of social and work environment. By applying vocational learning they also strengthen their fine and gross motor skills and work demands. Not all entrants move from a structured vocational training to an employment centre. Adults who need higher interventions from the staff continue to create value in an activity centre, where the environment is more relaxed and not target-oriented.
