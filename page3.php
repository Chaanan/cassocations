		This is something I have experienced during the process of becoming a Special Educator.
		I have experienced a change in my way of looking at things. I was very disturbed during my initial placements
		in special units. I was unable to apply my knowledge, as I was bound with the “problem” of an individual and 
		that it made me emotionally low. I wanted to do a lot but could not take a step further… I felt really very helpless.
