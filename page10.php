		In a unique initiative, Chaanan in partnership with National Trust (a statutory body constituted by Govt. of India for taking care of the needs of people with Autism, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability & multiple disabilities) has developed a residential facility for adults with intellectual disabilities. Located in south Delhi, our model of residential facility moves away from ‘care model’ to an empowering model of ‘Assisted living’.

The need for a residential facility for people with disabilities can be hardly overemphasised, they need support and supervision throughout their lives, particularly when parents are old, sick or pass away. The challenge is to conceptualise and create good models of assisted living that recognise not only the basic survival needs but also a whole range of other personal, social and psychological needs for fulfilled lives.
