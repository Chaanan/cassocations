		The team consists of the Executive Board, teachers and administrative staff, volunteers from the community and our trainees** and work associates* with intellectual disability. It is a group of dedicated and committed individuals, who believe in Muskaan’s vision and work toward fructifying its mission.
Every member of the team is a teacher, as they are invested in the work associates. The bond of understanding and trust between the trainer-trainee has, many a times, worked miracles for the person with intellectual disability.<br><br>
Be it the special educators, the administration staff or the support staff, they have one goal – treasure diversity by instilling a sense of self-worth and dignity in people with intellectual disability and see them bloom.
