				    Human mind is designed for learning. If we know how do we learn and 
				    understand the world around us, we can assist those people better who have difficulties in learning and comprehension.

					Intellectual disability means inadequate development of intellectual or cognitive 
					functions e.g. attention, learning, memory, sensory-perceptual processing, conceptual
					learning, thinking and reasoning etc. Appropriate training can strengthen these
					functions and can make one a better learner. Persons with intellectual disability have immense learning potential along with capacity for understanding, feeling, achieving and aspiring. They are concrete thinkers and have problems with abstract thinking, which is needed for academic learning. Just like everyone else, they need education, training and work opportunities for self-growth. We, as parents and teachers, need to understand how to facilitate the process of development which is not different from others. It requires hopeful attitude and creative thinking on our part.

					The key issue with intellectually challenged persons is the difficulty in
					learning which has a cumulative effect in other areas of functioning as well. 
					Appropriate training programs at every stage of development are the answer to 
					multiple challenges faced by them and their parents. Past three decades of working with
					intellectually challenged boys and girls in Muskaan Vocational Training & Employment Center has reinforced
					our belief that once adequately motivated and trained they learn and achieve much more than what is generally
					expected of them. Their keenness, enthusiasm and perseverance for learning and working and zest for life have
					been a source of inspiration to all of us.</p>
